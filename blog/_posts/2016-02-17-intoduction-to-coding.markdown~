It's been quite awhile since my last few posts. A lot has been going on and normally I just don't find the time to write posts. So I've decided that for awhile, I'll just be writting posts about a wide range of topics. This post, however, will NOT cover how to code in Java/C++/C#/etc., it WILL cover understanding how to code and how to learn to code.

## So you want to code?
Right off the bat, coding isn't for everyone. Not everyone likes computers, and not everyone likes to step outside of the comfort zone that many call a UI (User Interface). However you're reading this, so we are assuming that, yes, you do want to learn how to write code. A few set of basic prerequisites are also needed to understand/learn how to code

- You know computers. At the very least understand how to install software, how to protect yourself digitally, etc.
- You can think logically, or at least a basic understanding of algerbra. 
- You know how to search the internet.

I will cover these three key points over the entire post.

## Choosing a language
Many people will consider languages to learn as their first programming language. This first language is very important, in that learning future languages will come very quickly depending on how similar the new language is to your first language. Take for instance Java. Learning Java first will make it a breeze to learn languages like Scala, Go, C#, because they are all extremely similar regarding the syntax. For me, after learning Java as my first language, C++ and Python was difficult because of how unfamilar their syntax was. Here's a list of languages that you could choose as your first language, with a brief description.

- Java (My first language. Used for stuff like making applications without accessing too much hardware. Syntax is shared in a variety of languages. Great for making small projects.)

- C++ (Good for mesing around at the hardware level. Requires some knowledge of memory managment. Great for those looking to get into low-level programming. Syntax and file format is unique. However C++ is considered a 'dying' language, and is rarley used if Java can take it's spot)

- Python (Rapid, fast, robust, cross-platform development, however a syntax like no other by using indentations as its form of seperators. Used quiet a bit for small scripts. Doesn't have to be your first, but everyone should know it.)

- JavaScript/PHP (DON'T. Web development is extremely weird, and although Javascript has a similar syntax to languages like Java, both Javascript and PHP do not promote good coding practices.)

- I gernally recommend these as first languages, but any other language is fine. However smaller languages like Lua, Go, etc. will take its syntax from these big languages.



## Learning these languages.
This is where your ability to Google search comes in. You will want to find a good author/youtuber with a good series of tutorials. Prefferably already finished. I recomend TheNewBoston and Derek Bannas. Some authors may make a compressed 1hr version, those are for later, after you learn your first language. You're going to want to find a large multi-episode series that goes extremely in-depth with examples and tutorials. From there you can read books to gain a deeper understanding of the language. But don't rush this. Your first language will take monthes, and if you're lucky, weeks to learn. Follow through. Do not stop learning the language. Once you finish learning a language and can write and understand every example from your tutorials, everything below me will become relevant.

## I completely mastered the language...right?
Nope. With new features being added to languages every day you're never done, you just know what the general language population has an okayish grasp on. Certain features in Java 8 aren't needed and you can still do fine with the code and logic from a Java 7 application. And finishing a high school comp sci course, or finishing watching video tutorials, doesn't make you a master. Without practice none of this newfound knowledge will retain within your brain. 

## Android vs iOS
On the surface one could tell the UI differences from the YikYak Android app vs iOS app. But underlying there are also a few differences in the request. The API key I was talking about earlier is different between the iOS and Android applications. The Android key looks similar to an MD5 hash, while the iOS key contains dashes. I chose to debug and decompile the Android application because I did not have a jailbroken device accessible and had much more familiarity with Android app development. As far as I know the Android app generates the key from its package signature and encodes that value as well to generate the key. The User-Agents when sending requests differ with Android labeling itself as 'Android' and iOS labeling itself differently

## Rest in pieces Yodel
For those unaware of Yodel, like many other Windows Phone apps out there, was a third-party app that tried its best to emulate to emulate the official Yik Yak app because Yik Yak had not released a Windows Phone app. However since the app grew in popularity Yik Yak had recently sent a cease and desist letter to Soren21, the creator. It was honestly such a shame because 1) he had put a lot of effort, one could consider himself one of the pioneers for reverse engineering the Yik Yak API
and 2) a lot of people were basing their of library off of his JavaScript library because it was very well made. When his repository was finally taken down and replaced with a simple cease and desist it made me resentful at Yik Yak and the type of company it was running, preventing unofficial apps to cover what they themselves were too lazy to do. However rumors are in the air that they will release a third party API for developers as well as release a Windows Phone app, but still they remain only rumors.
