After a few days of guessing and checking with my GitHub pages, which yo can tell from the various useless commits on my GitHub, I have finally setup Jekyll Bootstrap the way I need it to despite the fact that I have no idea of how Ruby works or how Jekyll itself even works. I just needed a nice looking blog that I could easily contribute to whenever I needed to, it it seemed that Jekyll produced some of the best results. I haven't updated my site much at all over the past year, but that doesn't mean I'm dead, it's just that I've been too lazy to code HTML and Javascript ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . I have a lot of projects to update and perhaps a complete rewrite of my site itself because when I looked back on the code I wrote it looked horrible. Hope this post goes through!
