It's been quite awhile since my last few posts. A lot has been going on and normally I just don't find the time to write posts. So I've decided that for awhile, I'll just be writting posts about a wide range of topics. This post, however, will NOT cover how to code in Java/C++/C#/etc., it WILL cover understanding how to code and how to learn to code.

## So you want to code?
Right off the bat, coding isn't for everyone. Not everyone likes computers, and not everyone likes to step outside of the comfort zone that many call a UI (User Interface). However you're reading this, so we are assuming that, yes, you do want to learn how to write code. A few set of basic prerequisites are also needed to understand/learn how to code

- You know computers. At the very least understand how to install software, how to protect yourself digitally, etc.
- You can think logically, or at least a basic understanding of algerbra. 
- You know how to search the internet.

## Choosing a language
Many people will consider languages to learn as their first programming language. This first language is very important, in that learning future languages will come very quickly depending on how similar the new language is to your first language. Take for instance Java. Learning Java first will make it a breeze to learn languages like Scala, Go, C#, because they are all extremely similar regarding the syntax. For me, after learning Java as my first language, C++ and Python was difficult because of how unfamilar their syntax was. Here's a list of languages that you could choose as your first language, with a brief description.

- Java (My first language. Used for stuff like making applications without accessing too much hardware. Syntax is shared in a variety of languages. Great for making small projects.)

- C++ (Good for mesing around at the hardware level. Requires some knowledge of memory managment. Great for those looking to get into low-level programming. Syntax and file format is unique. However C++ is considered a 'dying' language, and is rarley used if Java can take it's spot)

- Python (Rapid, fast, robust, cross-platform development, however a syntax like no other by using indentations as its form of seperators. Used quiet a bit for small scripts. Doesn't have to be your first, but everyone should know it.)

- JavaScript/PHP (DON'T. Web development is extremely weird, and although Javascript has a similar syntax to languages like Java, both Javascript and PHP do not promote good coding practices.)

- I gernally recommend these as first languages, but any other language is fine. However smaller languages like Lua, Go, etc. will take its syntax from these big languages.


## Learning these languages.
This is where your ability to Google search comes in. You will want to find a good author/youtuber with a good series of tutorials. Prefferably already finished. I recomend TheNewBoston and Derek Bannas. Some authors may make a compressed 1hr version, those are for later, after you learn your first language. You're going to want to find a large multi-episode series that goes extremely in-depth with examples and tutorials. From there you can read books to gain a deeper understanding of the language. But don't rush this. Your first language will take monthes, and if you're lucky, weeks to learn. Follow through. Do not stop learning the language. Once you finish learning a language and can write and understand every example from your tutorials, everything below me will become relevant.

## I completely mastered the language...right?
Nope. With new features being added to languages every day you're never done, you just know what the general language population has an okayish grasp on. Certain features in Java 8 aren't needed and you can still do fine with the code and logic from a Java 7 application. And finishing a high school comp sci course, or finishing watching video tutorials, doesn't make you a master. Without practice none of this newfound knowledge will retain within your brain. Now comes practice. You MUST become creative. Invent your own projects, and make them a reality. This is the BEST practice of all.

## I'm Stuck!
Let me compress these points into bullets.

- Stackoverflow.com is your best friend for basic coding errors/issues. It's like Yahoo Answers, but better, and without KenM.

- Google stuff. Copy and paste errors, and know what links to click. 

- Understand the coding lingo. This will only come from practice. Certain lingo won't always be mentioned in tutorials, however a quick Google search can give you a general idea what it means

## Rinse and Repeat
Done with a project? Do another one. Do another one. Do another one. It's like an endless while loop. Maybe learn a new language along the way, now you can watch those 1hr compressions. This is the best way to become a programmer, and hopefully you can become a more creative and logically thinking person. GlHf!
